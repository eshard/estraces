estraces is a Python library to manipulate side-channel trace sets. It aims at giving a clear and uniform API to handle
traces samples and metadata for various persistency and file formats.
It uses [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org) to handle data.

estraces was originally developped and maintain by [eshard](https://www.eshard.com), and is heavily used in the open-source
side-channel analysis framework.

## Getting started

### Requirements and installation

estraces requires and must work on Python **3.6**, **3.7** and **3.8** versions.

You can install it by several ways:

- from source
- with `pip`
- with `conda`

>At time of writing, we highly recommend to install from `conda` when using `estraces` with **python 3.8**.

#### Installing from source

To install estraces from source, you will need the following requirements:

- `pip` and `setuptools` with version greater than **40.0**
- For Python **3.8**, you'll need to build and install `h5py` from source see [H5PY installation instructions](https://h5py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#source-installation) before installing `estraces`

From the source code folder, run:

```python
pip install .
```

#### Installing with `pip`

First, you should update your `pip` and `setuptools` version:

```bash
pip install -U pip setuptools
```

If you use **Python 3.8**, you must first build and install `h5py`, [see instructions](https://h5py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#source-installation).

```bash
pip install estraces
```

#### Installing with  `conda`

To install from `conda`, simply run:

```bash
conda install -c eshard estraces
```

### Opens a trace set

If you have a trace set as binary files, you can get a trace header set by using the binary reader:

```python
# First import the lib
import estraces

# We suppose the binary files are under traces/ and are named something.bin
my_traces = estraces.read_ths_from_bin_filenames_pattern(
    'traces/*.bin', # First indicate the filename pattern for the bin file
    dtype='uint8', # Indicate the numpy dtype of the data
    metadatas_parsers={} # This dict allows to associate metadata
)
```

You can then read your samples:

```python
# This will return the data for the first 100 traces
my_traces.samples[:100]

# This will return the frame 0 - 1000 of all the traces as a numpy array
my_traces.samples[:, :1000]

# You can iterate on traces
for trace in my_traces:
    # do something
```
